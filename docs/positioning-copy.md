# gg-deploy

**Free hosting deserves free tooling. Domain → GitHub Pages in 60 seconds.**

I'm [Abe Diaz](https://abediaz.ai). By day, I lead Amazon's disaster relief tech—using AI and logistics to deliver 26+ million relief items across 200+ disasters. On weekends, I build tools.

gg-deploy is my latest: domain deployment automated, built in a weekend, open source, free forever. It's not going to save the world—my day job handles that. But it might save you an hour of DNS configuration.

**One command. One click. One prompt.** Works via CLI, desktop app, web UI, or AI assistant (MCP).
```

### Features Section (Add Context)

```markdown
## Why I Built This

GitHub Pages is free. Domain registration is cheap. But connecting them? That's still 15 minutes of DNS googling, A-record guessing, and "did I break my email?" anxiety.

I wanted deployment to be as fast as the hosting is free. So I built gg-deploy with Claude Code over a weekend—CLI for power users, web UI for everyone else, MCP for AI agents, and desktop apps because why not.

**AGPL-licensed** because good tools should stay free.

### "About the Builder" Section (NEW)

```markdown
## Built by a disaster relief technologist

I'm Abe Diaz. At Amazon, I lead a team that uses AI and logistics to deliver relief supplies within 24 hours of disasters striking—26+ million items across 200+ disasters and counting.

On weekends, I apply the same approach to developer tools: identify friction, build fast, give it away.

gg-deploy started as a personal itch. Connecting domains to GitHub Pages shouldn't require 15 minutes of DNS archaeology. So I spent a weekend and built what I wanted: deployment in 60 seconds, not 60 minutes.

**AGPL-licensed** because the best tools are the ones everyone can use—and improve.

## 3. Social Media Snippets

### LinkedIn Post (Professional)

```
Shipped something new: gg-deploy v2.0

At Amazon Disaster Relief, I've learned that speed matters. When hurricanes hit, we get supplies moving in hours, not days. The same principle applies to developer tools—friction kills momentum.

gg-deploy automates domain deployment to GitHub Pages. DNS, SSL, CNAME—all configured in 60 seconds instead of 60 minutes. Supports Cloudflare, GoDaddy, and Namecheap.

What's interesting: I built this in a weekend. The entire stack—CLI, web UI, desktop apps for Mac/Windows/Linux, and MCP integration for AI agents—shipped in 48 hours.

It's open source (AGPL) and free forever. Because good tools should be accessible to everyone, from solo developers to nonprofits to startups.

Try it: npx gg-deploy ui

### Twitter/X Thread (Casual)

```
🧵 What can you build in a weekend with AI?

I spent last weekend with Claude Code and shipped:
- CLI tool
- Web UI
- Desktop apps (Mac, Windows, Linux)
- MCP server for AI agents

All for one purpose: deploying domains to GitHub Pages in 60 seconds instead of 60 minutes.

---

1/ The problem: GitHub Pages is free. Domain registration is cheap. But connecting them? 15 minutes of DNS archaeology, A-record guessing, and "wait did I break my email?"

---

2/ The solution: gg-deploy

One command: `npx gg-deploy apply mydomain.com user/repo`

It handles DNS records, CNAME files, GitHub Pages config, and SSL. Works with Cloudflare, GoDaddy, and Namecheap.

---

3/ What surprised me: building with AI doesn't just make you faster. It makes you more ambitious.

"Should I add a desktop app?" → Why not, Claude can help
"MCP integration?" → Let's try it

48 hours later: shipped all of it.

---

4/ My day job is leading disaster relief tech at Amazon. We use AI to optimize humanitarian logistics.

Turns out the same "move fast, reduce friction" mindset works for developer tools too.

---

5/ It's open source (AGPL) and free forever.

Try it: npx gg-deploy ui
GitHub: github.com/abe238/gg-deploy

If you're building with AI, I'd love to see what you're shipping. 🚀
